This project was created with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition v16.9.2 and Angular CLI version 11.2.5.

## How to run the project
Open the project in Visual Studio and build the solution. You could use **dotnet-cli** too. 

Open a terminal (PowerShell, Command-prompt) in the `ClientApp` directory and run `npm install`. 

You should be able to run the project now.
